# Term Tac Toe

This started as a way to try our curses library, but it turned out to be fairly interesting.

Basically, this is Tic Tac Toe in a terminal interface (TUI).

## Installation

Nothing to install---just run the code!

## Usage

    python -m term_tac_toe [board_size]

`board_size`: the number of cols and rows of the board
